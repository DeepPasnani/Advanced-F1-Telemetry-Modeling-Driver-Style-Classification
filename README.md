# Advanced-F1-Telemetry-Modeling-Driver-Style-Classification
This project uses F1 telemetry data to model race performance and classify driver behavior with machine learning. By analyzing speed, throttle, braking, and gear data, we uncover unique driving styles and predict lap times. The system provides insights into sector performance, tire wear, and strategy optimization.
